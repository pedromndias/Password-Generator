## Overview
This app is based on a solo project that was suggested during the Frontend Developer Career Path at the Scrimba platform. It was built after a given Figma design, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- This is an interface that can generate 4 different random passwords after a button is clicked.
- I added some extra features, like choosing the number of characters for the password and copying the new password just by clicking on it.

## Running the project:
This project is live on the following link: [https://passgenerator-pedro.netlify.app/].
Alternatively, you can just download the files and open the index.html on your browser.
